**V 1.5 :**

- Appearance changes - outgoing messages
- Adding some optimization parameters to reduce network load without reducing standard security, suitable for a wide range of applications
- Improving the script and improving the performance of optimizers
- Ookla Speedtest optimization

**V 1.4 :**

- **New :**
- New Tcp Congestion Control : Hybla and Cubic
- Status option: displays the current Qdisk and Congestion Control algorithm of the operating system. (For the correct display, it is necessary to reboot the system after every change and configuration and check again)
- **Changed items :**
- Menu categories have changed :
- Option CakePlus > BBR Base > BBR + Cake
- Each of the Congestion Controls will have the possibility of activation with three types of Qdisk : FQ_CODE, FQ, CAKE.
- Appearance changes
- Improved performance

**V 1.3:**

- Optimization in the configuration of algorithms
- Algorithms will be applied only in the main interfaces to avoid further processing and reverse optimization.
- Optimization: fixing the detection problem and... in some operating systems.
- The performance of the recovery option was optimized. Be sure to restore and then reboot before applying the new settings.

**V 1.2:**
- Cake algorithm was added as an advanced Qos algorithm in combination with BBR:

**Cake will be used as a professional Qos algorithm in the queuing layer (Qdisc) and it will manage traffic queuing in the best possible way and minimize jitter and delay.
And BBR will be used in the congestion control layer as Tcp Congestion Control and provides the most optimal data transmission speed without causing congestion in TCP traffic.**
- In both installation modes, the original file is backed up.
- Improvements in the option to restore settings.
- Improvements in ecn applications
- Improvements in applying the algorithm
- Qos-qdisk algorithm will be applied on different interfaces, such as when the IP6 interface is separate.
- Improvements in installing packages
- Improvements in running speed test and...

**V 1.1 :**
- Optimized
- Checking the compatibility of the operating system and the kernel
- Making changes for modern distributions and alternative methods for older systems in Python
- Check and install required packages
- ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) activation
- The queuing algorithm (fq or fq_codel) for the network interface and qdisk in the operating system and network cards that do not support or are not completely set due to reasons such as the old network card, etc. will be set by automatic checking by the script = **More optimization**
Also, the feedback messages have been improved so that users are better informed about the status of the execution of the steps.

- Full configuration
- Backup and restore applied settings

**Speed ​​test:**

- 2 Method For Bench.sh speedtest

- Speedtest Between 2 server With Iperf3

- Speedtest By ookla With the possibility of specifying a server

    <summary><strong>Tips</strong></summary>
    

- **My suggestion is at least Ubuntu 20.04 and above (22 and above) and Debian 10 and above (at least 11 or 12 and above) (because bbrv2 is used in newer kernels) especially for vpn, games, calls, etc. is**
- **Supported operating systems » Ubuntu version 18 and above - Debian 10 and above**
- Be sure to run it in the root user or with **sudo** command
- **reboot** is required to apply the changes
- It is recommended to use a similar configuration in tunneling and tunneled servers so that the performance is more optimal and the algorithms of both servers are in harmony with each other. For example, if you have two servers that are tunneled together, activate your desired algorithm . for example, BBR + FQ_CODEL on both servers (if you do not apply it on one of the servers, in fact, that server will used default settings and it algorithm will be different with Optimized server and it will prevent the from full increase of tunnel efficiency and etc.)
